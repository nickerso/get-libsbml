## **libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ (experimental)**
###Installers for Mac OS X operating systems

**Important**: Before you install libSBML using these installers, please **uninstall any existing copy of libSBML** located in the same destination on your computer, or you may end up with mixed versions of different libSBML components on your system.


### **_C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python and Ruby installers_**

This directory contains installers for precompiled versions of libSBML for Mac OS X systems.  They were built with the Apple-supplied version of the libxml2 parser library, and include accepted SBML Level 3 packages plus interfaces for the following programming languages:

* C
* C++
* C# (Mono)
* Java
* Javascript
* Perl
* Python (but see below for a better option)
* Ruby

By default, the installer will put libSBML into /usr.  Detailed information about how to make libSBML accessible to your software [is available on a separate web page](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-accessing.html).

### **_R interface_**

[The directory named "source/R interface"](R%20interface) contains the source package for the R libSBML library.

### **_Python installer_**

If you are primarily interested in Python, we provide a simpler solution for installing libSBML using PiPI.  First, make sure you have the following prerequisite software packages installed on your operating system: `python-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libz-dev`, and `libbz2-dev` (or their equivalents for your specific environment).  Then, you can use the following command to install libSBML for Python:

```
sudo pip install python-libsbml
```

After you have installed the Python libSBML library, follow the instructions for [how to access libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/python-api/libsbml-accessing.html).


### **_MATLAB and Octave_**

If you need the MATLAB/Octave language interfaces, or need to use a different XML parser library, it will be necessary to build libSBML yourself from the source distribution using suitable configuration flags.  The procedure is described in [the libSBML documentation](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/docs/cpp-api/libsbml-installation.html).  The source and documentation are available from the top-level download directory, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/@PACKAGE_VERSION@).


### **_How to uninstall libSBML_**

To uninstall libSBML, please run the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh
```

(If you chose to install libSBML into a directory tree other than `/usr/local`, then please look for the `uninstall-libsbml-pkg.sh` script in the `bin` directory of that alternate location.)

---

Please note: the code in these directories reflects the current state of
development of SBML Level 3 packages and the libSBML plug-ins for the
packages. Many of the SBML Level 3 package specifications have not yet been
finalized, and the package implementations are themselves in a state of
development.  The binaries available may be untested and are supplied
'as-is' for experimental development only.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about this software.

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The LibSBML Team.
